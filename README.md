Hi, Iâ€™m @Gamerelk
This Repository Is Dedicated To My Work Coding In Mostly Minecraft Bedrock JavaScript (Js).
There Are Two Take Away Things I Always Think You Should Know About Me:

1.) I Write Every Word/Letter Captialized And Not Lowercased
2.) I Provide All Of My Code Free From Any Restrictions (Open Source Code)

I Also Like Posting Custom Minecraft Templates Of My Addons As Well.

(For People Using My Stuff. I Dont Care If Your Credit Me Or Not In Your Addons)
